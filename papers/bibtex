abstract={Advanced Driver Assistance Systems have been shown to greatly improve road safety. However, existing systems are typically reactive with an inability to understand complex traffic scenarios. We present a method to predict driver intention as the vehicle enters an intersection using a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The model is learnt using the position, heading and velocity fused from GPS, IMU and odometry data collected by the ego-vehicle. In this paper we focus on determining the earliest possible moment in which we can classify the driver's intention at an intersection. We consider the outcome of this work an essential component for all levels of road vehicle automation.},

title={Real-time Prediction of Intermediate-Horizon Automotive Collision Risk},
abstract={Advanced collision avoidance and driver hand-off systems can benefit from the ability to accurately predict, in real time, the probability a vehicle will be involved in a collision within an intermediate horizon of 10 to 20 seconds. The rarity of collisions in real-world data poses a significant challenge to developing this capability because, as we demonstrate empirically, intermediate-horizon risk prediction depends heavily on high-dimensional driver behavioral features. As a result, a large amount of data is required to fit an effective predictive model. In this paper, we assess whether simulated data can help alleviate this issue. Focusing on highway driving, we present a three-step approach for generating data and fitting a predictive model capable of real-time prediction. First, high-risk automotive scenes are generated using importance sampling on a learned Bayesian network scene model. Second, collision risk is estimated through Monte Carlo simulation. Third, a neural network domain adaptation model is trained on real and simulated data to address discrepancies between the two domains. Experiments indicate that simulated data can mitigate issues resulting from collision rarity, thereby improving risk prediction in real-world data.},

ABSTRACT = {Situational assessment (SA) is one of the key parts for the application of intelligent alternative-energy vehicles (IAVs) in the sustainable transportation. It helps IAVs understand and comprehend traffic environments better. In SA, it is crucial to be aware of uncertainty-risks, such as sensor failure or communication loss. The objective of this study is to assess traffic situations considering uncertainty-risks, including environment predicting uncertainty. According to the stochastic environment model, collision probabilities between multiple vehicles are estimated based on integrated trajectory prediction under uncertainty, which combines the physics- and maneuver-based trajectory prediction models for accurate prediction results in the long term. The SA method considers the probabilities of collision at different predicting points, the masses, and relative speeds between the possible colliding objects. In addition, risks beyond the prediction horizon are considered with the proposition of infinite risk assessments (IRAs). This method is applied and proved to assess risks regarding unexpected obstacles in traffic, sensor failure or communication loss, and imperfect detections with different sensing accuracies of the environment. The results indicate that the SA method could evaluate traffic risks under uncertainty in the dynamic traffic environment. This could help IAVs’ plan motion trajectories and make high-level decisions in uncertain environments.},

//Eliminate risk by looking at vehicles road occupancy

title={Interaction-aware occupancy prediction of road vehicles},
publisher={IEEE},
pages={1-8},
abstract={A crucial capability of autonomous road vehicles is the ability to cope with the unknown future behavior of surrounding traffic participants. This requires using non-deterministic models for prediction. While stochastic models are useful for long-term planning, we use set-valued non-determinism capturing all possible behaviors in order to verify the safety of planned maneuvers. To reduce the set of solutions, our earlier work considers traffic rules; however, it neglects mutual influences between traffic participants. This work presents the first solution for establishing interaction within set-based prediction of traffic participants. Instead of explicitly modeling dependencies between vehicles, we trim reachable occupancy regions to consider interaction, which is computationally much more efficient. The usefulness of our approach is demonstrated by experiments from the CommonRoad benchmark repository.},

title={Towards a safety mechanism for platooning},
publisher={IEEE},
pages={502-507},
abstract={Platooning has shown to be technically feasible, but safety aspects are still challenging. Wireless communication between vehicles allows to maintain reduced inter-vehicle distances, thereby improving traffic throughput and decreasing fuel consumption. As the driver can no longer be a backup at short inter-vehicle distances, the system needs to be fail-safe for both hazardous traffic situations as well as failures. In this paper, a scenario is defined which combines a hazardous traffic situation with a communication failure. First, the methodology for developing safety related functionality in automated driving is presented. This methodology combines aspects of the ISO26262 standard with the Harmony profile. Second, the safety mechanism to avoid a collision by braking is described. This ensures that a safe state can be reached for a set of use cases which are derived from the defined scenario. Finally, the proposed solution is tested in a simulation environment and is also implemented on test vehicles. The result of the simulations and experiments demonstrate the practical validity and show increased safety related functionality.},
