You have come to the repository of my master's thesis, "Intersection Navigation for Automated Vehices: Risk Assessment and Maneuver Coordination".

In this project, I have developed a simulation environment, a risk assessment algorithm and a maneuver coordination protocol for automated vehicles driving through a four-way give-way intersection. I have also integrated these three software components.

Here is a short video of the simulation environment and the coordination algorithm in place: https://youtu.be/CsFfsAazl7w
